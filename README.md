## 💡 Ideation
As we are offline, a conversation between others can be started and end up very naturally. But, in online conditions such as Whatsapp, Kakao Talk, sending messages to each other sometimes seems very awkward in contrast to offline conditions. So, [@이가영](mailto:il.sweezy@gmail.com) thought we can make the online environment similar to offline.
Then, how do we do that? Like people saying good-bye when they end up their small talk, we thought that chat bubbles can go furthermore when we end up our conversation automatically.
